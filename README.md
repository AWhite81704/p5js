Hi! Thanks for checking out my code :)
Below are some brief descriptions of each project:


# H1 1. Space Image
Space Image is a simple code which creates an image of a sun and a small rocket ship.

# H1 2. Space Animation
Space Animation is an interactive animation in which the user can use the mouse and keys to change the perimeter length and the color of varying objects respectively.

# H1 3. Pac Chase
Pac Chase is a fun albiet clunky experience where a pac-man follows the mouse around.
